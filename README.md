# Pixel Pandemonium ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’¥

**A chaotic, collaborative, on-chain pixel art canvas built for the Monad Mission 6 Hackathon.**

---

### What is Pixel Pandemonium?

Pixel Pandemonium is a real-time, multiplayer dApp where users can collaboratively create pixel art. However, there's a chaotic twist: every time a user places a pixel, the canvas fights back by changing another random pixel to a random color. The goal isn't to create a masterpiece, but to embrace the chaos and have fun in a truly "left-curve" on-chain experience.

To participate in the pandemonium, each pixel placement requires a tiny "ticket" fee, paid via a transaction on the **Monad Testnet**.

### How It Works: The Tech Stack

This project is a modern dApp that combines a reactive frontend with a real-time collaborative backend and on-chain interactions.

* **Frontend:** Built with **React** and **Vite** for a fast, modern user experience.
* **Web3 Connectivity:** Uses **Wagmi** and **RainbowKit** to seamlessly connect to users' wallets (like MetaMask).
* **Real-Time Collaboration (The Multisynq Requirement):** Powered by the **Multisynq Client SDK** (`@multisynq/client`). We adopted the core Model-View architecture to create a stable, real-time, and synchronized experience for all users, loading the library directly as per the official "Hello World" examples.
* **Smart Contract:** A simple `PixelPayment.sol` contract, written in **Solidity** and deployed on the **Monad Testnet**, acts as a ticket machine.
* **Deployment:** The frontend is deployed on **Vercel** for public access.

### How It Meets the Hackathon Rules

We designed Pixel Pandemonium specifically to meet and exceed the requirements of Mission 6.

1.  **âœ… Is it open source?**
    * Yes. The entire codebase is publicly available in this GitHub repository.

2.  **âœ… Does it use Multisynq in some novel way?**
    * Yes. We use Multisynq's core SDK to manage the state of our collaborative canvas. The "novel" part is our **chaotic rule engine** built into the `CanvasModel`. Instead of just synchronizing user input, the model itself introduces chaos by changing a random pixel on every user action. This turns Multisynq from a simple state-sharing tool into the engine of our "pandemonium".

3.  **âœ… Does it interact with Monad Testnet?**
    * Yes. Every single pixel placement is gated by an on-chain transaction. Users must call the `placePixel()` function on our deployed smart contract and pay a `0.00001 MON` fee, proving a direct and meaningful interaction with the Monad Testnet for the core functionality of the app.

4.  **âœ… Bonus: Is it silly and/or left curve?**
    * Absolutely! The core concept of a canvas that actively sabotages the users' creations is inherently silly. It subverts the traditional goal of pixel art (creation) and replaces it with a fun, unpredictable, and chaotic experience (pandemonium).

### How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [URL_OF_YOUR_GITHUB_REPO]
    cd pixel-pandemonium
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
    * Add your Multisynq credentials:
        ```env
        VITE_CROQUET_APP_ID="io.pixelpandemonium.hackathon"
        VITE_CROQUET_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  **Connect your wallet:**
    * Open the app in your browser.
    * Make sure your MetaMask (or other wallet) is connected to the Monad Testnet.
    * Get some testnet MON from a faucet if you don't have any.
